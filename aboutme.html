    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <div class="square">
      <p>
        My journey into the world of web development has been both rewarding and
        exhilarating. Through the comprehensive curriculum at SheCodes
        Foundation, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond.
        This foundational knowledge has empowered me to create engaging and
        interactive user experiences on the web. However, learning doesn't stop
        at the classroom. I've had the privilege of collaborating with seasoned
        developers, contributing to the creation of responsive websites and
        functional applications.

        These experiences have not only enriched my technical acumen but have
        also instilled in me the importance of teamwork, attention to detail,
        and adherence to best practices. One of my core strengths lies in my
        ability to adapt and learn quickly. As technology evolves at a rapid
        pace, I am committed to staying abreast of the latest trends and
        methodologies in front end development. Whether it's mastering a new
        framework or refining my design skills, I embrace challenges with
        enthusiasm and perseverance.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my technical skills, I bring to the table a strong work
        ethic and a relentless drive for excellence. I thrive in dynamic
        environments where innovation is encouraged and collaboration is valued.
        With a keen eye for detail and a passion for crafting exceptional user
        experiences, I am poised to make meaningful contributions to any project
        I undertake.
